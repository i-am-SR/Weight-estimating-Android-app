# Weight_measuring_Android_App
An android app that measures your height and uses it to calculate your weight

Smartphones are all over the place! The time has passed for tools to be needed to measure height and weight. Our application can measure a personâ€™s height and waist width with just a smartphone and estimate his or her weight based on the data collected.Then we are passing the data collected to the server which will estimate the weight of the person and send back to the application.
